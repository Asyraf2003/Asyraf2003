## 🧠 About Me
I’m **Asyraf**, a builder who thrives on **efficiency, clarity, and control**.  
I use **Arch Linux** as my main OS - not just for speed, but for **total ownership** of my workflow.  
From Openbox setups under **500 MB RAM** to self-made scripts inside `~/bin`, I design every layer to be efficient and reproducible.  

On the dev side, I focus on **Laravel**, **Docker**, and **AWS Cloud** - bridging backend development with infrastructure automation.  
My long-term goal is to master **DevOps**, from coding and CI/CD to scalable cloud deployment and system hardening.

## 🧾 Philosophy
> “Custom is powerful - as long as you understand every line you configure.”  
That’s why I build from scratch - whether it’s a Laravel backend, Docker network, or Arch setup.  
I believe in **clarity, reproducibility, and elegant simplicity** above everything else.
